## Antlr4 by Terence Parr

What is ANTLR?  
ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files. It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks. From a grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build and walk parse trees. From the [Antlr website](https://www.antlr.org/)
